# Font-ah!

Quickly prototype a text using random settings. Use it to find a font/color/size combination for a text in a single place, with a little help from... fate.

Just:
* enter the text
* use the buttons in the header to change colors, size and typeface
* copy font and color params from the footer


Supported fonts sources:
* [x] Google Fonts
* [ ] Typekit
* [ ] other sources? Issue please!


What's next:
* [ ] share your work and collaborate with a unique link
* [ ] bookmarks, w/ local storage persistence
* [ ] combinations history
* [ ] copy css
* [ ] mobile-friendly
* [ ] use hyperapp subscriptions for media-change
